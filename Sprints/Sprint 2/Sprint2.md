# Sprint 2

02/07 - 03/04

## Summary

In Sprint 2, on the frontend, our team successfully created the login page and the landing page with a search bar using MaterialUI, react-hooks and react-bootstrap packages. To give a nod to UF our landing page consists of a Gator as the mascot. We also put in work on the single restaurant page, and added location info and hours, based on data scraped from UF web resources. We also took this time to set up the cypress testing environment and create our very first test. Because our pages are not linked together yet and we don't have a lot of functionality hooked up yet, we only have a single basic UI test at the moment.

Further work will be done to link the login pages, landing page, and restaurant pages together, as well as add more comprehensive end-to-end tests as more functionality is added.

In the backend, we were successfully able to set up the basic database end points in accordance to the ER Diagram. Re-organized the file structure for backend to encourage proper abstraction. Controller Methods for Query Processing for Establishment, User, and Review tables were added. Tested the functionionalities implemented using basic unit testing.

Further work would include writing scripts to send verification email to Users during first login. Also, we intend to add other tables into the database to support future functionalities being employed in the front-end
