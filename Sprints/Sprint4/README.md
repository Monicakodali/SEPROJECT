# Sprint 4
04/02 - 04/20

## Description of Application

UF Yelp, much like Yelp, is an application that will allow students to look up, sort, and review different establishments around Gainesville, scraped directly from the UF Campus Map website. Users will be able to leave ratings and detailed reviews of places found primarily on and around UF campus. Students can create an account with their UFL emails to share their honest opinions of the places they visit. Additionally, students will be able to get directions, see hours of operation, and read the reviews left by other patrons before they deciding to go there. While this iteration only contains dining establishments, this application is also prepared to handle other types of establishments such as libraries and campus buildings and dorms in the future.
