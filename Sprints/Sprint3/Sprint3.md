# Sprint 3

## Summary
In Sprint 3, on the frontend, our team successfully created the sign up page and the user is able to successfully sign up as the sign up page is hooked up to the backend. The landing page was made more user friendly. User is able to successfully leave a review on the establishment. Furthermore, a user is able to successfully login as the login form is hooked up to the backend and is able to see a profile navigation bar as well.

In the backend, we aimed to do the proper associations in terms of constraints such as foreign keys, unique value to explain the dependence between models. We recreated the database structure in accordance with our ER model. Since we intend to add more functionalities in terms of catering to different types of establishments, we have tried to connect the data in a more conventional DBMS way.
