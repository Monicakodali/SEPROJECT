By: Carol Navya Pagolu, Monica Bhargavi Kodali,Manjari Misra, Andrew Kuczynski

Traveler’s blog is an application that will allow users to have a look at different shopping spots, restaurants and stay suggestions as per their requests in Gainesville. It would let the user make an itinerary as we can also include top rated places to visit around the desired location. Below are some of the functionalities we are aiming to try and achieve. 
## MOTIVATION:
Traveler’s Blog will be a one-stop application where users can have collective information about top rated places instead of searching for each place on google.
## FUNCTIONALITY:
1. When a traveler is looking for a restaurant/shopping spots/stays: <br />
a.Different places amongst the categories mentioned above (restaurants, shopping spots, stays) could be displayed with the help of previous reviews and ratings by         other travelers. <br />

2. When a traveler reaches his destination: <br />
